Tour management system is a method to plan your HOLIDAYS. It basically comprises of three parts â€“
  1. User
  2. Admin
  3. Hotel
The combination of all these three helps in implementing this database. In this project the application formed helps the user to plan his leave to a Country or state within his country or any other city. The key aspects are booking a Hotel in the destination place as well as giving the user an idea about how much the trip will cost him.
So, basically it helps the user to manage a trip as per his/her convenience considering his budget and the time and the preferred location.
The admin behind the screen makes contact with the hotel and also keep a check on the payment portal. This how all the three parts of the system works.
Basically, in all when a user registers the unique user id gets stores in the database being managed by the admin. After registering user enters the destination with his/her details like the number of members accompanying him followed by his budget. Now, as per these details the admin a back provides him with the available hotels within his budget. And, finally the user decides whether he/she would like to go for it.
